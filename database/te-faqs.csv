"Income Share Agreement","I am interested in your ISA, but I have some credit issues. Should I apply?","We do consider major credit issues like charge-offs, bankruptcies, and delinquencies, but we encourage all students to apply, so we can review credit history and determine eligibility."

1. You make 48 payments.

2. Your cumulative payments reach the payment cap at 1.5x funded tuition.

3. The maximum timeframe for your agreement of 96 months — the payment window — expires."
"Income Share Agreement","When do ISA participants start making payments?","After the course, graduates have a payment-free grace period of 3 months.

If students don’t secure employment earning $3,333.33 per month (which annualizes to $40,000.00 per year) before their grace period expires, they must reach out to The Tech Academy’s servicing partner, Stride Funding, to request deferment.

This threshold to begin payback applies to all jobs — full-time and part-time, regardless of the field."
"Income Share Agreement","What is the application & approval process for an ISA?","Interested students can apply for their ISA here.

The program to which they have been accepted.
Their financial need (the tuition amount you’ll request).
One reference(s)/communication contact.

"Income Share Agreement","Who is eligible to apply for an ISA?","Stride’s ISA program is available to:

Full Time Java Web Application Development Bootcamp.
Students with U.S. citizenship or permanent residency.
Students 18 or older at the time of contract execution.
The ISA tuition plan is currently only available for Tech Elevator’s Full-Time Program. ISA plans are not available for residents of: California, New York, Iowa, Illinois, Washington D.C., Colorado, Washington, Alabama, or South Carolina. Read more information on Stride Funding’s Privacy Policy."
"Income Share Agreement","What benefits does the ISA program offer for students?","The ISA provides a different way to pay for Tech Elevator’s full-time Java Web Application Development Bootcamp. As part of the program, if participants make more, they pay more, and if participants make less, they pay less. If participants don’t get a job after the program, they don’t pay anything at all.

ISA payments will not begin until after employment is secured, and only if total income is at least $40,000.00 per year. The percentage of the income participants pay stays the same, but monthly payments may go up or down depending on salary. If graduates earn a high income, a total payment cap will limit how much they are required to pay. No participant will ever pay more than 1.5x the cost of tuition."
"Income Share Agreement","What is the Stride Funding & Tech Elevator ISA program?","Tech Elevator’s Income Sharing Agreement (ISA) Program is powered by Stride Funding. An ISA is a contract in which a student receives educational funding in exchange for an agreed-upon percentage of future income over a defined period of time.

Students accepted into the ISA program won’t pay anything up front. They’ll first complete the full-time Java Web Application Development Bootcamp. Then, only once graduates have landed a job earning at least $40,000.00 annually, they’ll start paying back their 10% or less of their income over 48 months."
"Income Share Agreement","What is the difference between a traditional installment loan and ISA?","Unlike traditional installment loans, an ISA is rooted in the student’s ability to make repayments on funding.

A traditional installment loan for Tech Elevator:

Fixed payment means you have to pay regardless of what you may earn
Rigid payment schedules force you to pay even if you don’t have a job
Require co-signer or high current income for students
3-10 years
An ISA for Tech Elevator

Payments tied to income give you confidence that payments remain affordable, no matter your earnings
Pay nothing during months where you make less than the minimum income threshold
Stride ISAs do not require a co-signer for students
48 month payment term (over a maximum of 96 months) for a the ISA Program"

"Matchmaking","This seems like a big process. Can’t you just send me some resumes?","It’s our pleasure to help you match with the candidates that best fit your job description.

"Matchmaking","How much does it cost to participate?","Matchmaking is free to schedule and participate!"

To be successful you have to be focused and dedicated.  We ask that all applicants for Tech Elevator’s full-time program be prepared to either take time off or step away fully from their jobs. Alternatively, we also offer a Part-Time Program that allows for students to learn at a more flexible pace.

For many it’s not hard to say goodbye to their current, unfulfilling job knowing that Tech Elevator will be their onramp to a new, satisfying career. If you love your company (but maybe not your role), consider talking to your employer about the program and how it can enhance your skill set for the job, or help them in other areas. Rather than lose you completely they may be willing to support you, sometimes with tuition support, sometimes with a leave of absence. It never hurts to ask!"

"The Basics","Does Tech Elevator require COVID-19 vaccinations?","In alignment with county requirements and local public health recommendations, some Tech Elevator campuses require in-person students to be up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccinations, as defined by the CDC. Tech Elevator also reserves the right to amend its policies at any time in response to changing public health and safety concerns—up to and including shifting its in-person instruction to Live Remote learning.

We have chosen to require vaccines to ensure the safest possible classroom experience, following the CDC and state regulatory guidelines, without inconveniencing students and Tech Elevator staff. Knowing that all students in a Tech Elevator campus are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations minimizes the risk of exposure and spread of the COVID-19 virus and reduces potential disruption during the cohort due to CDC quarantine and isolation requirements.

Students will demonstrate that they meet this requirement prior to picking up their laptops by showing proof of their vaccination, such as vaccination card(s).

For students who are unable or do not wish to receive the vaccine or those who feel more comfortable learning remotely, Tech Elevator offers our National Live Remote program starting the same day as in-person classes.
